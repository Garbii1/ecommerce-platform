# Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform


A complete e-commerce web application built using the MERN-like stack (MySQL instead of MongoDB) with separate frontend and backend services, designed for free-tier deployment. Features include product browsing, searching, shopping cart, user authentication, role-based access, basic admin dashboard functionalities, and Stripe payment integration (Test Mode).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended, e.g., v18+)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   A [Railway](https://railway.app/) account (for hosting the database during local development - free tier available)
*   A [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account (for payment testing - free test mode available)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Garbii1/ecommerce-platform.git
    cd ecommerce-platform
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a Railway MySQL database service in your Railway project dashboard.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables (get values from Railway, Stripe, and generate your own JWT secret):
        ```dotenv
        # Get from Railway MySQL service -> Variables tab (use the PUBLIC host/port for local dev)
        DATABASE_URL=mysql://USER:PASSWORD@PUBLIC_HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME

        # Generate a strong random string (e.g., using Node crypto or openssl rand -hex 32)
        JWT_SECRET=YOUR_REALLY_STRONG_JWT_SECRET_KEY

        # Optional: JWT Expiration (defaults can be set in code)
        JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d

        # Your LOCAL frontend URL for CORS
        FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

        # Get from Stripe Dashboard (Test Mode -> Developers -> API Keys)
        STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

        # Get from running `stripe listen --forward-to ...` locally (see Stripe Setup)
        STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_LOCAL_STRIPE_CLI_WEBHOOK_SECRET
        ```
    *   Set up the database tables: Connect to your Railway database using an SQL client (like TablePlus, DBeaver) and run the SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements found earlier in the project setup guide (or in a dedicated `schema.sql` file if you create one).
    *   Start the backend development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The backend should be running on `http://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in `.env`).

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
        *(If you are inside the `backend` directory, use `cd ../frontend`)*
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following environment variables:
        ```dotenv
        # Your LOCAL backend API endpoint
        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api

        # Get from Stripe Dashboard (Test Mode -> Developers -> API Keys)
        NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
        ```
    *   Start the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The frontend should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Access the Application:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

    *   `GET /products/{id}`: Get a single product by ID.
    *   `POST /products`: Create a new product (Admin only).
    *   `PUT /products/{id}`: Update a product (Admin only).
    *   `DELETE /products/{id}`: Delete a product (Admin only).

## Deployment Notes

*   **Backend:** Deployed on Railway. Requires environment variables (`DATABASE_URL` [usually injected], `JWT_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV=production`, `FRONTEND_URL_PROD`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) set in the Railway service settings. Root directory set to `/backend`.
*   **Frontend:** Deployed on Vercel. Requires environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) set in the Vercel project settings. Root directory set to `/frontend`.
*   **CORS:** Ensure the `FRONTEND_URL_PROD` on Railway matches the Vercel deployment URL.
*   **Database:** MySQL hosted on Railway (Free tier limitations apply).
*   **Stripe Webhook:** A production webhook endpoint needs to be configured in Stripe pointing to the deployed backend URL, and the corresponding production `whsec_...` key used in the Railway environment variables.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

*   **CORS Errors:** Encountered CORS blocking between the deployed Vercel frontend and Railway backend. Solved by ensuring the correct Vercel URL was added to the `FRONTEND_URL_PROD` environment variable on Railway and restarting the backend service.
*   **Build Failures (ESLint):** Vercel builds initially failed due to strict ESLint rules (`react/no-unescaped-entities`). Solved by escaping special characters (like `"` and `'`) in JSX text content using HTML entities (`"`, `'`).
*   **Build Failures (Module Parsing):** Faced "Unexpected token" errors during the build, often pointing to JSX. Typically resolved by ensuring correct file extensions (`.js`/`.jsx`) and fixing any subtle syntax errors preceding the problematic JSX.
*   **Tailwind CSS Class Issues:** Encountered errors where custom or even default Tailwind classes ("Cannot apply unknown utility class") were not recognized. Resolved by ensuring correct Tailwind/PostCSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.mjs`), verifying compatible package versions (especially with Tailwind v4), and clearing the Next.js cache (`.next` folder) before restarting the development server.
*   **Database Connection Errors (`ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNRESET`):**
    *   `ENOTFOUND`: Occurred when trying to connect from local machine/Node.js to the database using the *internal* Railway hostname. Solved by finding and using the *public* database connection URL/host/port provided by Railway in the local `.env` file.
    *   `ECONNRESET`: Connection reset by the database server, often due to idle timeouts on free tiers. Mitigated by implementing a basic retry mechanism (`queryWithRetry`) in the backend controllers for read operations.
*   **React Hydration Errors:** Faced "Hydration failed" and "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors.
    *   Caused by discrepancies between server-rendered HTML and initial client render, often due to nested invalid HTML (like `<a>` inside `<a>`, `<form>` inside `<form>`) or accessing `localStorage`/Zustand state too early on the client.
    *   Solved by fixing invalid HTML nesting (updating Next.js `<Link>` usage, removing nested forms) and implementing an `isMounted` state check in `_app.js` to delay rendering until the client is ready, allowing state hydration to stabilize.
*   **Stripe Image/SVG Errors:** `next/image` failed with `ENOTFOUND` when trying to optimize images from `via.placeholder.com` (Node.js DNS issue) and `dangerouslyAllowSVG` errors with `placehold.co` (returned SVGs). Solved by switching placeholder service to `picsum.photos` (which Node.js could resolve and returns raster images) and updating `next.config.mjs` `remotePatterns` accordingly.
